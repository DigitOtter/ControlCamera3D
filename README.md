# OrbitalCam3D add-on for Godot 4.x

**OrbitalCam3D is an addon that provides a 3D camera with rotation, translation, zooming and lookat features, like in Godot's editor**.

This repository contains the add-on and examples.

## Features

- Rotation of the camera around pivot point (`LEFT` or `MIDDLE` mouse button).
- Translation of the camera (with `SHIFT`).
- Zooming in/out with mouse's wheel (and pad).
- LookAt function (`RIGHT` mouse button).
- Works on desktop platforms and HTML5.

## Usage

`OrbitalCamera3D` node is used like `Camera3D` node. Place your camera in a 3D scene but unlike  `Camera3D`, it will point itself to a point in space called *pivot*. By default, this point is placed at the origin of the global reference `Vector3(0,0,0)`.

This camera can rotate around this pivot ("middle click" by default), move laterally in the camera plane ("shift key") and also zoom in and out with the mouse wheel (or pad).

Moreover, you can rotate the camera on itself ("right click").

`OrbitalCamera3D` has two properties :
- The pivot's position `pivot_pos` that can be modified by the code and by the camera itself.
- `orbital_mouse_button` to choose the mouse button that triggers the rotation and translation of the camera (`LEFT` or `MIDDLE` buttons).
